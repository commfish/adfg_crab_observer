## Example Workflow

### Load libraries, global options, custom functions, and raw data

``` r
# load ----
## custom functions and libraries
source("../misc/code/custom_functions.R")

## most recent season
season <- "2019_20"

# data inputs ----

## dockside data
dock <- read_csv(here("bbrkc/data", "RKC-1990-2019_dockside.csv"))

## observer crab detail data
obs_meas <- read_csv(here("bbrkc/data", "RKC-1990-2019_crab_dump.csv"))

## count pot data
pot_sum <- read_csv(here("bbrkc/data", "RKC-1990-2019_potsum.csv"))

## fish ticket data by stat area
fish_tick<- read_csv(here("bbrkc/data", "bsai_crab_fish_ticket_summary_stat_area.csv"))

## parameters for calculated weight estimation
params <- read_csv(here("misc/data", "weight_parameters.csv"))
```

Each RKC dataset is manipulated to achieve the following:

1.  Combine directed and cost recovery fisheries for observer and
    dockside sampling data  
2.  Restrict timeseries to only include rationalized fisheries (this
    step is ony temporarily and will be change in the future)  
3.  Sum fish ticket summary data across stat area. **Note**: *directed
    and cost recovery fisheries are not combined in fish ticket data*.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# data management ----

## clean observer and dockside data timeseries

dock %>%
  # combine bbrkc tf and directed fishery
  mutate(fishery = gsub("XR", "TR", fishery)) %>%
  # filter for only fisheries since rationalization
  filter(as.numeric(substring(fishery, 3, 4)) >= 5,
         as.numeric(substring(fishery, 3, 4)) < 80,
         !(fishery %in% c("CO05", "QO05o"))) %>%
  # remove 'r' in QO05 fishery code
  mutate(fishery = gsub("r", "", fishery)) -> dock

obs_meas %>%

  filter(as.numeric(substring(fishery, 3, 4)) >= 5,
         as.numeric(substring(fishery, 3, 4)) < 80,
         !(fishery %in% c("CO05", "QO05o"))) %>%
  # remove 'r' in QO05 fishery code
  mutate(fishery = gsub("r", "", fishery)) -> obs_meas

  # filter for only fisheries since rationalization
  filter(as.numeric(substring(fishery, 3, 4)) >= 5,
         as.numeric(substring(fishery, 3, 4)) < 80,
         !(fishery %in% c("CO05", "QO05o"))) %>%
  # remove 'r' in QO05 fishery code
  mutate(fishery = gsub("r", "", fishery)) -> pot_sum

## summarise fish ticket data by fishery
fish_tick %>%
  dplyr::select(-stat_area, -cpue, -avg_wt, -price_lbs) %>%
  group_by(fishery) %>%
  summarise_all(sum, na.rm = T) -> fish_tick
```

### Item 1

Total catch of females, sublegal males, and legal males in the directed
BBRKC fishery (including cost recovery) is estimated from observer count
and measure pot data. Nearly all observer pots in the BBRKC fishery are
measure pots.

To estimate total catch number, totals of each group (females, sublegal
males, and legal males) caught in a fishery are divided by the total
number of observer pot lifts in that fishery (observer CPUE) and
multiplied by the total fishery pot lifts. Total catch weight (lbs) is
estimated using only observer measure pots. The number of crab by
fishery, group (females, sublegal males, and legal males), carapace
length (1 mm bins), and maturity status (male, immature female, mature
females) is summarised and a calculated weight (lbs) is estimated by an
allometric growth function. Maturity is included as immature and mature
females have different shape and scale parameters for the growth
function. Total weights caught of each combination of characters are
summed, divided by the number of observer *measure pot* lifts and
multiplied by the total fishery pot lifts.

``` r
## get observer measure pot effort 
pot_sum %>%
  # filter for measured pots in bbrkc directed fisheries
  filter(substring(fishery, 1, 2) == "TR",
         msr_pot == "Y") %>%

  mutate(fishery = gsub("XR", "TR", fishery)) %>%
  group_by(fishery) %>%
  summarise_all(sum, na.rm = T) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(substring(fishery, 1, 2) == "TR") %>%
  dplyr::select(fishery, effort) -> directed_effort

## get total catch by legal group in numbers
pot_sum %>%
  # get count of female, sublegal and total legal by fishery, total observer pots
  group_by(fishery) %>%
  summarise(female = sum(female, na.rm = T),
            sublegal = sum(sublegal, na.rm = T), 
            tot_legal = sum(tot_legal, na.rm = T),
            obs_effort = n()) %>%
  # pivot to long format
  pivot_longer(c(female, sublegal, tot_legal), names_to = "group", values_to = "count") %>%
  # join to directed fishery effort
  left_join(directed_effort, by = "fishery") %>%
  # compute total catch
  group_by(fishery, group) %>%
  summarise(total_catch_num = (count / obs_effort) * effort) -> total_catch_num
  
## comput total catch weight (lbs) with measure pot data
obs_meas %>%
  # remove crab without a legal code
  filter(!is.na(legal)) %>%
  # decipher legal could into legal group
  f_sdr(col = "legal", type = "legal") %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(grepl("legal_", legal_text), "tot_legal", legal_text)) %>%
  # add maturity based on clutch
  mutate(maturity = case_when(sex == 1 ~ "male",
                              (sex == 2 & clutch == 0) ~ "immature",
                               (sex == 2 & clutch != 0) ~ "mature")) %>%
  # count by fishery, sex, group, size, maturity
  count(fishery, spcode, sex, group, maturity, size) %>%

            by = c("spcode", "sex", "maturity")) %>%

         opening_year == as.numeric(substring(season, 1, 4))) %>%
  write_csv(here(paste0("bbrkc/output/", season), "item1_total_catch_directed_fishery.csv"))
```

### Item 2

Total catch of females, sublegal males, and legal males in the Bering
Sea Tanner crab fishery east of 166 W longitude is estimated from
observer count data. Total catch number is estimated by totaling each
group (females, sublegal males, and legal males) caught in a fishery,
dividing by the number of observer pot lifts in that fishery (observer
CPUE) and then multiplying by the total fishery pot lifts. Total catch
weight (lbs) is estimated by multiplying total catch number by the
average weight for each sex (not each group, *this can be changed if
necessary*). If no directed Tanner crab fishery east of 166 W longitude
took place in the preceeding season, the output will consist of an empty
.csv file with column headers.

``` r
## get direct effort in the bbrkc fishery
fish_tick %>%
  filter(substring(fishery, 1, 2) == "TT") %>%
  dplyr::select(fishery, effort) %>%
  rename(directed_effort = effort) -> directed_effort

## estimate total bycatch
pot_sum %>%
  # filter for direct E166 tanner crab fisheries
  filter(substring(fishery, 1, 2) == "TT") %>%
  # summarise number of crab caught by sex
  group_by(fishery) %>%
  summarise(female = sum(female, na.rm = T),
            male = sum(sublegal, tot_legal, na.rm = T),
            obs_effort = n()) %>%
  # join to observer effort
  left_join(directed_effort, by = "fishery") %>%
  # pivot to long format add sex code
  pivot_longer(c(female, male), names_to = "sex_text", values_to = "count") %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex_text == "male", 1, 2)) %>%
  # join to average weight by fishery and sex
  left_join(f_average_wt(obs_meas, by = 1), by = c("fishery", "sex")) %>%
  # compute total catch number and weight (lbs)
  mutate(total_catch_num = (count / obs_effort) * directed_effort,
         total_catch_lbs = total_catch_num * avg_wt) %>%
  # remove unneeded data
  dplyr::select(-obs_effort, -directed_effort, -sex, -count, -avg_wt) %>%
  # decipher fishery code and filter for past season
  f_sdr(col = "fishery", type = "fishery_code") %>%
  filter(opening_year == as.numeric(substring(season, 1, 4))) %>%
  # save output
  write_csv(here(paste0("bbrkc/output/", season), "item2_total_catch_tanner_crab_e166.csv"))
```

### Item 3

data management section. This data is simply filter for the past
seasonâ€™s directed and cost recovery BBRKC fisheries.

``` r
fish_tick %>%
  # filter for bbrkc directed and cost recovery fishery
  filter(substring(fishery, 1, 2) %in% c("TR", "XR")) %>%
  # decihper fishery code and filter for most recent season
  f_sdr(col = "fishery", type = "fishery_code") %>%
  filter(opening_year == as.numeric(substring(season, 1, 4))) %>%
  # save output
  write_csv(here(paste0("bbrkc/output/", season), "item3_fish_ticket_summary.csv"))
```

### Item 4
