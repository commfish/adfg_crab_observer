## Purpose
Summarise raw crab observer, dockside sampling, and fish ticket data to estimate fishery removals (i.e., directed catch and bycatch) for Alaskan crab stocks. For details on data reports and summaries for specific stocks, see below.  

## Data sources
Available fishery data includes 1) onboard observer data, 2) dockside sampling of retained catch, and 3) fish ticket data. Observer data is further subdivided into two main catagories: measure pots and count pots. Measure pot data includes counts of crab caught in observer pots by group (e.g., sex, legal status) with the addition of biological characteristics on each crab (e.g., carapace width, shell condition, clutch condition). Count pots include only counts of crab by group (e.g., sex, legal status). Observer and dockside data are provided in three large files by species: 
* SPECIES-1990-2019_crab_dump - measure pot data for a single species caught in all BSAI fisheries in which it was encountered from 1990 - 2019 (present year).
* SPECIES-1990-2019_potsum - count pot data for a single species caught in all BSAI fisheries in which it was encountered from 1990 - 2019 (present year).
* SPECIES-1990-2019_dockside - dockside sampling data for a single species retained in all BSAI fisheries from 1990 - 2019 (present year).  

Fish ticket data summarises retained catch and total known effort (directed and indcidental). Fish ticket summaries are provided by statistical area for each directed fishery in the most recent season, and/or by trip including both directed and incidental effort and catch.

## Data Products
### Snow crab
1. **item1_dockside_size_comp** - Size frequency by shell condition of retained catch.
2. **item2_snow_crab_bycatch_size_comp** - Size frequency of snow crab caught in every BSAI crab fishery (including the directed snow crab fishery) by sex, shell condition, legal status (i.e., T/F; True = male, CW &geq; 78 mm), and fishery.
3. **item3_snow_crab_retained_catch** - Total retained live catch and deadloss (from fish ticket data) for the directed snow crab fishery.
4. **item4_total_bycatch** - Point estimates of total catch number and total catch weight (lbs) of snow crab by sex in each crab fishery in which snow crab were caught.
5. **item5_snow_crab_fish_ticket_stat_area** - Fish ticket data for the directed snow crab fishery summarised by statstical area.

### Tanner crab
