## Purpose
Summarise raw crab observer, dockside sampling, and fish ticket data to estimate fishery removals (i.e., directed catch and bycatch) for Alaskan crab stocks. For details on data reports and summaries for specific stocks, see below.  

## Data sources
* Observer crab detail - biological data collected on individual crab for all species from measure pots during all BSAI crab fisheries.
* Observer count pot summary - counts of crab by sapecies caught in observer sampled pots in each fishery. 
* Dockside sampling size composition - size frequency of retained catch by shell condition for each species and fishery.
* Fish tickets - summaries of retained catch (in number and weight) and effort (directed and incidental) by fishery, species, and statistical area or trip.

### Products
1. **item1_QO19_dockside** - Size frequency by shell condition of retained catch collected by dockside samplers.
2. **item2_bycatch_size_frequency** - Size frequency of snow crab caught in every BSAI crab fishery (including the directed snow crab fishery) by sex, shell condition, legal status (i.e., T/F; True = male, CW &geq; 77 mm), and fishery.
3. **item3_5_QO19_retained_catch** - Fish ticket data for QO19 summarised by statiscal area. Totals are found in the last row.
4. **item4_total_bycatch** - Point estimates of total catch number and total catch weight (lbs) of snow crab by sex in each crab fishery in which snow crab were caught.
5. **item3_5_QO19_retained_catch** - Fish ticket data for QO19 summarised by statstical area.
