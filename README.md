Summarise raw crab observer, dockside sampling, and fish ticket data to estimate fishery removals (i.e., directed catch and bycatch) for Alaskan crab stocks. For details on data reports and summaries for specific stocks, see below.  

## Snow crab
### Data sources
* Dockside sampling size frequency by shell condition and sex (ADF&G database)
* Observer size frequency of snow crab in all crab fisheries (ADF&G database)
* Observer catch species composition in all crab fisheries (ADF&G database)
* Fish ticket summaries by fishery and statistical area (Ocean AK, provided by ADF&G Dutch Harbor staff)

### Products
1. **item1_QO19_dockside** - Size frequency by shell condition of retained catch collected by dockside samplers.
2. **item2_bycatch_size_frequency** - Size frequency of snow crab caught in every BSAI crab fishery (including the directed snow crab fishery) by sex, shell condition, legal status (i.e., T/F; True = male, CW &geq; 77 mm), and fishery.
3. **item3_5_QO19_retained_catch** - Fish ticket data for QO19 summarised by statiscal area. Totals are found in the last row.
4. **item4_total_bycatch** - Point estimates of total catch number and total catch weight (lbs) of snow crab by sex in each crab fishery in which snow crab were caught.
5. **item3_5_QO19_retained_catch** - Fish ticket data for QO19 summarised by statstical area.
